## Getting Started  

Create `.env` file in the root of repository and add a single key-value pair with `OPENAI_TOKEN` as a key and your OpenAI token as a value:  
```env
OPENAI_TOKEN="YOUR_OPENAI_TOKEN"
```  

Then, generate environment files using `build_runner`:  
```console
flutter pub run build_runner build
```  

After that, run the project on any available platform ðŸŽ‰  
```console
flutter run
```  

## Specification

The project has a few demonstrations of OpenAI usages in mobile applications.  

Project uses:  
- <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/envied">`envied`</a> for local secrets management.  
- <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/get_it">`get_it`</a> for dependency management.  
- <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc">`flutter_bloc`</a> for state management.  
- <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/openai_client">`openai_client`</a> for <a href="https://openai.com/api/">OpenAI API</a> (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs">doc</a>) interactions. 

### Basics

In addition to basic localization feature, the application has an ability to change the OpenAI text model, that will be used across the app.

### Demo: Simple chat

This page demostrates an ability to create a simple chat to interact with user.  
It is possible to send a message and get a response from OpenAI bot.  
Application is not sending a full conversation to OpenAI, so that the text model is not aware of the context of the conversation.

### Demo: Motivationals

This page demostrates an ability to create a unique motivational message for the user.  
It is possible to generate motivational text and copy it to the clipboard.  
Such messages might be used is a certain place on user dashboard in real applications.
